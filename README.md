# Machine Learning
In this repository I will upload jupyter-notebooks
which contain different models applied to a variety of datasets,
and try to mantain the following process:

- Prepare the data (feature engineering,data cleaning, impute variables, etc)
- Build and train the model(model selection, hypter-parameter tuning, etc)
- Validate the model(apply different metrics to test the model)

As we can see there is not the final step, that is putting the model into
production. Why? Because thats another big part of the process and we need
to use another set of tools, appart from not having knowledge of a bussines objective.
